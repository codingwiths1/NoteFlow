# 📝 NoteFlow – A Google Keep Inspired Note App Built with Flutter

**NoteFlow** is a fast, lightweight note-taking app built with Flutter. Inspired by Google Keep, it allows users to quickly add, delete, and organize notes with a beautiful and responsive UI. This app is designed with clean architecture, simple UX, and offline-first capabilities using GetStorage.

## 💡 About the Project

I created NoteFlow inspired by Google Keep, not just to replicate it but to understand and build the structure, logic, and performance behind a real-world note-taking app. It handles multiple notes, uses reactive programming, and persists data locally — all without a backend.

This project is ideal for users who want a minimal and efficient note app, and for teams looking for Flutter talent who can build clean, functional UIs.
